# About

The project allows the user to create a custom CV application with contact info, education and work experiance. The project used functional React Components, where I learned more about utilizing state and hooks in React. I also learned more JSX, and how useful it is to break parts of the project down into smaller components. I am looking forward to continue learning the React framework with my next projects.
